In This repository I will post many projects related to data science

# The First Project
## Finding Donors for CharityML

Investigated factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on real census data. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the likelihood of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm efficiency.

See my implementation and report [here](https://github.com/robertyoung2/Finding-Donors-for-CharityML/blob/master/finding_donors.ipynb).

### Project Brief

In this project, you will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. You will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, you will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. You will then evaluate several supervised learners of your choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, you will optimize the model you've selected and present it as your solution to CharityML. Finally, you will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

### Project Evaluation

My project was evaluated against the [Finding Donors for CharityML project rubric.](https://github.com/robertyoung2/Finding-Donors-for-CharityML/blob/master/Finding%20Donors%20for%20CharityML%20project%20rubric.pdf). 

# The Second Project
## Breast Cancer Classification

This project aims to predict people who will survive breast cancer using machine learning models with the help of clinical data and gene expression profiles of the patients. Using machine learning models on gene data helps us better understand the disease and determine how well treatment methods work.


# The Third Project
A classification approach to the machine learning Titanic survival challenge on Kaggle.Data visualisation, data preprocessing and different algorithms are tested and explained in form of Jupyter Notebook
